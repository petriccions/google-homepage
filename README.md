# Google Homepage
This is an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) and my first project with HTML/CSS. 
Like its name, it is only a homepage with buttons/texts linked to google things. This google-homepage project cannot search anything.
The purpose of this project is to help me understand how everything is placed on the page.
